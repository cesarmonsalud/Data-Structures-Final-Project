Technical Requirements: C++ 11 or higher

Code Organization:

Our code is oragnized into 3 seperate groups of files:
 
 User.h/cpp: Stores all information and functions relating to a User. Contains the User class and other helper functions.

 Network.h/cpp: Stores all functions and variables relating to the network of users. Contains the network class and our 3 main functions.

 main.cpp: Contains the code to our user interface. Can run all of our functions with test data by running the main file and following the instructions in the   interface.
 
How to test our code:

Testing all of our functions is as simple as running our make file and then running the main file. Once the main file is run, the user will be greeted with a variety of options. Depending on what the user wants to test, all they have to do is type in the number cooresponding to said action and hit enter.
