Team Contract 
(kbevans2-ndepies2-cmonsa2-lmathes2)
 Communication 
Team Meetings: Our team will meet once a week sometime on Thursday (subject to change).

Assistance: Each team member can be contacted through iMessage, or email. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to messages within 24 hours. 

Respect: All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Ties for voting will be determined by a coin flip. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them. 
Collaboration 
Work Distribution: Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. Each time a function or some sort of work is added, that team member will update the shared document to match their work progress to ensure the work flow is consistent. 

Time Commitment: To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. 

Before pushing code to the repository, team members will make sure that their code is working properly. By signing this contract team members acknowledge that they will provide snacks to the meeting if they push code that causes segmentation faults or does not compile.
